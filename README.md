## Introduction

As sports like futsal,badminton,and volleyball continue to grow in popularity among iium students and staff,there is an increasing demand for streamlined and effective facility management systems. This proposal presents the development of a **FITPLEX*, a web-based platform built with the **Laravel framework**, designed to facilitate the reservation and administration of sports facilities.

The system aims to modernize how users interact with facility booking services, replacing manual and error-prone processes with an efficient, user-friendly digital solution. It allows users to view available facilities, book time slots, manage their reservations, and optionally view their booking history. On the administrative side, it provides tools to manage facilities, monitor bookings, set time slot availability, and track facility usage.

Built using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture of Laravel, the system ensures scalability, code reusability, and maintainability. This project focuses on improving operational workflows and delivering a smooth experience for both users and administrators.

##  Objectives

The primary objective is to develop a full-featured web application that simplifies the management and booking of sports facilities. Specific goals include:

1. **Provide a User-Friendly Booking Platform**  
  Users should be able to register, view available sports facilities, book available time slots, and manage their own reservations with ease.

2. **Utilize Laravel MVC Framework**  
   Implement the Laravel framework effectively using its routing system, Eloquent models, controllers, views (Blade), and built-in tools like middleware and validation.

3. **Implement Secure User Authentication and Authorization**  
   Use Laravel‚Äôs built-in authentication to ensure secure access for users and role-based privileges for administrators.

4. **Enable Efficient Facility and Booking Management for Admins**  
   Allow administrators to manage facilities, set availability, view booking lists, and optionally approve or cancel bookings.

5. **Provide Optional Reporting and History Tracking**  
   Include optional features such as booking history for users and facility usage reports for admins.

- **Challenge Or Difficulties**

- **Collaboration Issues with GitHub**:  
  Our team encountered problems in connecting and linking our GitHub repositories effectively.

- **Difficulties with Live Share Tools**:  
  Using tools like Live Share for real-time collaboration proved challenging. Limited familiarity and technical difficulties, such as connection lags, disrupted seamless collaboration during coding sessions.

- **Time Management Constraints**:  
  Balancing project work with academic and personal responsibilities was a major challenge. Team members had differing schedules, which made it difficult to coordinate meetings and work sessions.

- **Learning Curve for Tools and Frameworks**:  
  Adopting new tools and frameworks like the MVC architecture required extra effort from the team to understand and implement effectively. This slowed down the initial development phase.

- **Debugging and Testing**:  
  Debugging errors in the code often led to the discovery of new issues, creating a cycle of fixing and retesting. This process was extremely time-consuming and required significant attention to detail to ensure all functionalities worked as intended.
